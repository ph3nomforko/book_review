# Book Review Project
## Introduction
This project is meant to fulfill the requirements of the fourth module of the software engineering curriculum with the Flatiron School. It is a single-page JavaScript application that is a book repository with a function for users to leave comments about their favorite books.
## Getting Started
To get started, pull the code from the repository and run `bundle install` from your terminal. After it has bundled properly, run `rails db:migrate && db:seed` to get some basic seed data. Next, start up the server with `rails s`. Finally, to visit the page, open index.html with your file system. You now have your own book repository to keep track of all the books you want to read and have read.
